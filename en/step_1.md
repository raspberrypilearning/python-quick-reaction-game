## Introduction

In this resource, you're going to make a quick reaction game using a few electronic components and a Python script. If you've never before used a breadboard, some buttons, and an LED, you might find it helpful to work through some of the exercises in [Physical Computing with Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing) first. This will give you a better understanding of how to control components with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

## What you will make
This project gives you the opportunity to use electronics to create a quick reaction game which you will program using Python. If you have little or no experience of creating circuits, don't worry: this guide will walk you through it and by the end you will have a fun game to play with your friends.

title: What you will learn
---
 By making this quick reaction game, you will learn:
 
 - How to wire a simple circuit that includes a breadboard, LED, resistor, wires, and buttons
 - How to write a program to control the circuit
 - How to use variables to store information
 - How to get user information like a player's name and use it in the game.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
